 - train on vgg16 and get a baseline result
 - provide interface for CNN with covariates

 - training with ALL the covariates makes the model parameter number way too large. 
 - It's infeasible and we should only try a few
 - If our goal is to see whether covariates help with predication, one way to conduct experiment is to use a lighter network as baseline
 as we really don't need vgg16 particularly. We could use vgg9 or something even lighter
 - We could also select the most informative covariates using a random forest or something similar.
